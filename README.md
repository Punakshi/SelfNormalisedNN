# Self-Normalizing Networks
Implementations based on "Self-normalizing networks"(SNNs) as suggested by Günter Klambauer, Thomas Unterthiner, Andreas Mayr - Purpose: Learning

## KERAS CNN scripts:
- KERAS: Convolutional Neural Network on MNIST
- KERAS: Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR10

## Basic python functions to implement SNNs
are provided here: selu.py

## In order to reproduce Figure1 in the paper
Code snippets are provided here: Figure1

## Basic Implementation
Referred various sources and tutorials of pytorch to manipulate and implement functions
